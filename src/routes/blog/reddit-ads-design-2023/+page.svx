This past summer, I worked at Reddit on the Ads Design team in New York. I was surrounded by such a talented team of designers, and I was able to learn so much for working with them! The Ads team at Reddit is separated into several verticals, and I worked on three different projects that spanned the Measurement, Growth, and Reporting teams. It was a load of fun!

Before I begin, I wanted to thank everyone on the Reddit Ads and HR teams who made this summer so incredible. Thank you to my mentor **Gordon** and manager **Jen** helped me to scout valuable projects and prepared me to put in my best throughout the summer. Also, thank you to my wonderful team members on each of my projects (Cameron, Ein, Sarah, Nahva, and more) and my intern friends. You guys rock! Thank you to **Deitrick** and **Waverly** for planning amazing in-person intern events. I loved every second of it.

## Work projects

I unfortunately can't share too much work here, as my work was under a non-disclosure agreement, but I had a lot of fun developing solutions for three of ths Reddit Ads teams. The short of it is:
1. An **Image Scraper** that was built into the Reddit Ads "Simple Create" flow, which scraped images from the client's website to be used in ad creative with just the click of a button
2. A **Pixel Event Setup** overhaul, which reimaged the existing user experience to set up the Reddit Pixel on an advertiser's website and receive conversion event data (e.g. clicks, views, searches)
3. Explorations of new layouts and data visualization features for the **Reddit Ads home dashboard**, especially incorporating data from breakdowns and insights.

My work centered around improving the Reddit Ads experience for small business owners, who don't typically have the same capacity and prior knowledge about advertising on social platforms. When these features are launched publicly, I'll be sure to include more information and screenshots here.

## Exciting non-work things

After a half-remote internship in 2022 (mostly due to the lingering effects of COVID shutdowns), I felt so lucky to be surrounded by fellow Reddit interns every day in the New York office. I loved the community so much, and Reddit's in-person programming (both internship and NYC office) made it even better by planning special activities for us. Here are some delightful moments:

I can also say that I've officially worked in the tallest building in the western hemisphere. Thank you, Cond√© Nast!
